# Off Board Blink
The objective of this section of the lab is to use the development board to make at least two LEDs blink on an external breadboard. To do this, the development board must send the signal to the proper pins which are then jumper wired to a breadboard. The boards used in this exercise were the MSP430G2553 and MSP430F5529. The pins used in both boards were P1.0 and P1.6. To make it easier, I used the same pins for each board that way the code would be the same. I was able to do this on the F5529, because P1.6 is a GPIO and doesn't have to be connected to one of the on board LEDS.
