## Multiple Blink
In this exercise, I learned how to properly blink two different LED's on the development board at two different rates. Both LEDs blinked at a 50% duty cycle. To blink two different LEDs, I had to manipulate a seperate bit in the SFR registers. Like Simple Blink, BIT0 corresponded to P1.0 in the SFRs. In this exercise, we also manipulated the SFR registers with other bit indexes to correspond to different pins.
