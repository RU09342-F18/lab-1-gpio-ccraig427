# Multiple Blink
In this exercise, I learned how to properly blink two different LED's on the development board at two different rates. Both LEDs blinked at a 50% duty cycle. To blink two different LEDs, I had to manipulate a seperate bit in the SFR registers. Like Simple Blink, BIT0 corresponded to P1.0 in the SFRs. In this exercise, we also manipulated the SFR registers with BIT6 corresponding to P1.6.
