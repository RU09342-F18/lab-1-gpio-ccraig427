## Button Blink 
In this exercise, a button was implemented as a switch to control whether the LED is on or off. In the G2553, the button was connected to P1.3. In the F5529, the button used was connected to P1.1. 
A new register was used in this exercise called P1REN. This register controls the pull-up resistor connected to the button. In this exercise, we set the resistor to be normally high through the line P1REN = BIT3 corresponding to P1.3 for the G2553. In the F5529, the line of code to add a pull-up resistor to the button would be P1REN = BIT1. To execute the LED to switch, the button must be pressed changing the state of P1IN register. BIT3 is defined as 0x100.  As long as the 3rd bit of the P1IN register doesn't equal BIT3, the LED will switch. When the button isn't pressed, P1IN does equal BIT3.
